# nd101-project-2-image-classification
The second project of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree course.

The Jupyter notebook runs the code, with help of problem_unittests.py and helper.py that test the codes in separate cells.

The code was run on ASW instance.

# Description

# Image Classification

In this project, you'll classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. You'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded. You'll get to apply what you learned and build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers. At the end, you'll get to see your neural network's predictions on the sample images.
